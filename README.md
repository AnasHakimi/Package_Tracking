# All In One Package Tracking 

During my 4th semester in my degree, our team developed a Package Tracking System using the Eclipse MVC architecture. This system was designed to provide a seamless and efficient way for users to track their shipments in real time.

Technologies Used

Frontend & Backend: Java (Servlets, JSP)

Database: MySQL

Development Tools: Eclipse IDE, Apache Tomcat, phpMyAdmin

This project strengthened my Java development skills, deepened my understanding of MVC architecture, and enhanced my ability to build scalable and secure web applications. It also provided hands-on experience in database management, user experience design, and backend system development to improve operational efficiency.
